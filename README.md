# Diabetes Classification Training Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on training a diabetes classification model using a simple logistic regression approach. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the fundamentals of binary classification and serve as an educational resource for those interested in machine learning applied to healthcare datasets.

## Overview

The notebook guides you through the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the diabetes dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset for training by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Model Training:** Implement a simple logistic regression model using popular machine learning libraries.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the trained model using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the notebook:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avganshina/diabetes-classification-training-notebook.git
   cd diabetes-classification-training-notebook
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (you may use a virtual environment):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes_Classification_Notebook.ipynb
   ```

   This will launch the notebook in your web browser.

4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell and understand the process of training a diabetes classification model.
